# A small and simple lobby for your browzer

Ever got tired of common new tabs?

Do you hate common background images and want to personalize your browzing experience?

Do you have an unnecessary need for personalisation for everything you do even if it's not that optimal?

If that's your case, then you're lucky, because that's exactly what this is: a simple `HTML` with some `CSS` 

## Requirements:

The project itself has no dependencies, however, for editing you'll require `SASS` installed on your PC, or a lot of pacience to deal with vanilla `CSS` (use `Bootstrap` or whatever, I'm not your father)

After cloning the repository, you'll need to set this file as your default new tab

You can use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-start-page/mjfahldkpjhcnfbbmdhpjolcjpcfhcpj) extension for Chrome, Opera, and OperaGX

You can easily change the default new tab on Firefox [like this](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-set-the-home-page)

As for other browzers, you're on your own (sorry!)

## Contributions:

This is a personal project I thought someone like me out there could use.
I'd be happy to get new ideas and features

## Licenses:

This is a small personal project of mine

None of the images are mine, they're only placeholders for demonstration

If you have a issue with their use, contact me: [vinimanceprof@gmail.com](mailto:vinimanceprof@gmail.com) and I'll remove them
